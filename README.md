# PixelKrushEngine
PixelKrushEngine is a pseudo-game-engine/library built on top of LibGDX for my personal use. 
I published it on GitHub to use the GitHub Packages feature for ease of dependency loading in my projects, and also so that if someone else want to try it they're welcome to do so.<br><br>
